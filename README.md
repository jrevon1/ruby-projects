payroll.rb is simply a re-coded copy of my previous C++ payroll class project, but in Ruby 
(and with a few more tweaks to make it look nicer both in code form and when it runs)!

blackjack.rb is my attempt to create a blackjack game from scratch, but as of 8/23/2020 it is still very much a work in progress and should only draw two (unique) cards for now!
